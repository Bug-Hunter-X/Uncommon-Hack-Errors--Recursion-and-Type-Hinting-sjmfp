# Uncommon Hack Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when programming in Hack. These examples focus on issues related to recursion and type hinting.

## bug.hack
This file contains the buggy code that demonstrates the recursive function issue and a potential type hinting problem. 

## bugSolution.hack
This file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the recursion problem and clarifying type hinting where necessary. 

## How to Run

To run the Hack code, you will need to have the Hack compiler installed and configured. You can then compile and run the code using the appropriate commands for your system.
